# T-System ðŸš§ (under construction)

T-System is a lightweight Python-based, object-oriented financial data processing framework designed for historical (and upcoming real-time) market analysis. The design prioritizes flexibility without compromising efficiency.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Core (`core/`)**: Implements `Equity`, `Options`, `Event`, for structured market data using an object-oriented approach. The class `ContinuousSignal` provides a lazy frame wrapper for time series data.  
- **Analysis (`analysis/`)**: Provides tools for data visualization (`plots.py`) leveraging matplotlib, with support for price, volume, events and signals.

WARNING: For now, it tries to fetch data from Yahoo Finance every time it is executed. If the daily limit is reached, price data might not be shown.
